If you've made changes to RISC-V Vectorized Bencmark Suite that might benefit others, we strongly encourage
you to contribute those changes to the public RISC-V Vectorized Bencmark Suite repository. There are
several reasons to do this:
 * Share your work with others, so that they can benefit from new functionality.
 * Support the scientific principle by enabling others to evaluate your
   suggestions without having to guess what you did.
 * Once your changes are part of the main repo, you no longer have to merge
   them back in every time you update your local repo. This can be a huge time
   saving!
 * Once your code is in the main repo, other people have to make their changes
   work with your code, and not the other way around.
 * Others may build on your contributions to make them even better, or extend
   them in ways you did not have time to do.
 * You will have the satisfaction of contributing back to the community.


We are happy to report that progress is being made on integrating the RISC-V Vectorized Bencmark Suite and the Vector Architecture model on the official gem5-resources and gem5-public repositories respectively. Then, while both tools are under review, access to these temporary repositories will be available. Then, contributions can be done in this temporary repository.
